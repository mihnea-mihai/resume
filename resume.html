     I processed raw data exports into relevant reports and visualisations. I improved templates in order to minimise time spent with repetitive tasks and contributed to better defining and adapting the workflow. I also maintained a Wiki for technical and workflow procedures and provided basic technical support and liaised with the IT department in Austria.

     I translated various types of EP documents from EN and DE into RO, juggling with deadlines (both large documents due in two weeks and short, urgent ones due the next day), while also taking into consideration the deadlines of other teams (e.g. revision, postprocessing). I developed my language and translation skills not only through individual work experience, but also through constant feedback from and to my mentor and revisers. I performed terminology mining from parallel corpora based on co-occurrence and updated some entries of the EU's terminology database during a detail-oriented project. Outside my "normal" duties I signed up to schedule the language classes for trainees and taught Romanian while also composing a lessons blog for reference.

     I worked as a CS Agent for customers from German-speaking countries, simultaneously handling phone calls and emails in a non-linear fashion (urgent calls breaking the linear workflow). Daylong phone availability and high workload during peak season contributed to me acquiring a certain degree of stress management skills. In my quest to optimise my time spent working, I developed a dynamic spreadsheet to automatically compose emails. I also proactively reported a major security breach and revealed a fraudulent customer.
